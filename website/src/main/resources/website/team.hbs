		<p>For <strong>Laila LE GUEN</strong>, the Yorùbá Name dictionary was a great opportunity to engage with two things she was already drawn to: Yorùbá? language learning and expanding linguistic diversity online. She joined the project in March 2015 and she soon came to be involved in the drafting of the newsletter, blog post editing, as well as some social media interactions. She also endeavoured to bring on board Yorùbá? speakers from the Republic of Benin so as to ensure inclusive participation across borders. She hopes that this dictionary will become a multilingual reference point for anyone seeking information about Yorùbá? personal names, but also serve as an inspiration for other language communities.</p>
